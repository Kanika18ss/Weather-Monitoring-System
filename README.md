# Automated Weather Monitoring System

The Automatic Weather Monitoring System (AWMS) project aims to revolutionize weather monitoring in Mana, Uttarakhand, India. By deploying cutting-edge sensors and IoT technology, AWMS provides real-time weather data and predictive insights crucial for disaster preparedness and management. The project, spearheaded by Jaiprakash Power Ventures Limited (JPVL), not only ensures the efficient operation of the VishnuPrayag Barrage but also serves as a vital early warning system for the community, helping mitigate the impact of natural calamities such as floods and landslides. Through its user-friendly interface and seamless integration of data from API sources and IoT devices, AWMS sets a new standard for comprehensive weather monitoring and disaster response in the region.

## Objective
### 1. Real-Time Monitoring:   
Implementing sensors and IoT technology to enable real-time monitoring of weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.   
### 2. Organised Weather Data:    
Displaying weather fetched from IOT circuits and API on a website for easy access and past weather insights. Using weather conditions fetched from API, we can also get weather forecast of the village of Mana.   
### 3. User-Friendly Interface:    
Designing a user-friendly website with intuitive weather dash- boards accessible to Jaiprakash Power Ventures Limited (JPVL) personnel for dam man- agement and for early warning purposes.   
### 4. Enhanced Disaster Resilience:   
Enhancing disaster resilience by providing timely and ac- curate weather information, enabling proactive decision-making and mitigation measures to protect lives, property, and critical infrastructure in Mana village and its surroundings.  

## IOT Hardware
### • FC-22:
FC22 is a gas sensor commonly used in IoT applications to detect various gases such as methane, carbon monoxide, and propane. It operates on a voltage of 3.3V and provides real-time data on gas concentration, allowing for early detection of leaks or haz- ardous conditions. FC22 enables IoT systems to monitor indoor air quality, industrial environments, and safety hazards.
### • ESP-8266: 
ESP8266, often integrated into development boards like NodeMCU, is a ver- satile Wi-Fi module widely used in IoT projects. It features a low-cost yet powerful mi- crocontroller, making it suitable for tasks such as data acquisition, processing, and wireless communication. NodeMCU’s compatibility with the Arduino IDE simplifies programming, making it accessible to hobbyists and professionals alike.
### • BMP-180: 
BMP180 is a high-precision digital pressure sensor commonly used in IoT applications to measure atmospheric pressure and temperature. Its small size, low power consumption, and accuracy make it ideal for weather monitoring, altitude tracking, and indoor climate control systems.
